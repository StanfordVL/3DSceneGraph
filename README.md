# 3D Scene Graph: A Structure for Unified Semantics, 3D Space, and Camera

<img align="left" height="500" src="https://3dscenegraph.stanford.edu/images/3dscenegraph.png">

## Overview
The 3D Scene Graph provides semantic data for models in the [Gibson environment](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/) [1] that corresponds to the structure proposed in [3D Scene Graph: A Structure for Unified Semantics, 3D Space, and Camera](http://3dscenegraph.stanford.edu). The semantic information for models in the tiny Gibson split is verified via crowdsourcing and contains all 3D Scene Graph attributes. For these models we provide both the automated and verified outputs. For the rest of them, semantic information is the output of automated modules and does not include modalities that depend solely on manual input (e.g., object materials and textures). You can learn more about 3D Scene Graph and interact with the semantic data here: [http://3dscenegraph.stanford.edu](http://3dscenegraph.stanford.edu)

## Download
You can download the 3D Scene Graph data from the link below. The link will first take you to a license agreement, and then to the data. The data per model contains only semantics and is provided in the [compressed *.npz* format](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.lib.format.html). To download the raw data visit the [Gibson Environment's database](http://gibsonenv.stanford.edu/database/) and agree to their terms of use. A [loading function](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#tools_&_dependencies) that returns the data in the 3D Scene graph structure is included in the 'tools/' folder. Semantics per model correspond to the ```mesh.obj``` 3D meshes and the ```pano/rgb``` panoramas of the Gibson database. To learn more about the type of semantics included in 3D Scene Graph, see [Dataset Structure](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#dataset-structure).

## Dataset Structure

The 3D Scene Graph is composed of 4 layers: [```building```](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#building), [```room```](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#room), [```object```](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#object), and [```camera```](https://github.com/StanfordVL/3DSceneGraph/blob/master/README.md#camera). Below is a description of the semantic information per layer.

## Tools & Dependencies

We provide a loading function in ```tools/load.py```, which requires ```Python 3.5``` and the packages: ```trimesh, PIL```. You can run this function with the ```tools/load.sh``` script - remember to change the system paths to match your configuration where applicable. In the ```tools``` folder there is the ```palette.txt``` file that contains a list of distinct RGB colors used for visualization purposes, and the ```dictionaries.csv``` file that contains a list of the category subsets of each database we use that are present in the dataset (e.g., the object classes from COCO present in the tiny Gibson models, etc.).

## Automatic Labeling & 3D Scene Graph Generation

The automatic labeling and 3D Scene Graph generation pipeline is included in the ```source``` folder. The code has been tested with ```Python 3.6.8```. All required dependencies can be found in ```requirements.txt```. Install them by:

```
pip install -r $3DSceneGraph/requirements.txt
```

Inside ```source``` there are three folders, which correspond to the three main steps of the method: 

### 1. Framing

First sample rectilinear frames on the equirectangular images (```pano2rectilinear```) and, after inferring the instance segmentations for each of this frames with the method of your choice, use ```pano_aggregation``` to aggregate the predictions on the equirectangular image. Each folder contains a shell script that you can run to process each step. The file ```detections_format.txt``` contains a description of the format of the output file of the instance segmentation.

### 2. Multiview Consistency

This step aggregates all panorama instance segmentations on the 3D mesh (```multiview_consistency```). Run the included shell script to start the process.

### 3. 3D Scene Graph Generation

Once the previous steps are finalized, this step will compute attributes and relationships, essentially building the 3D Scene Graph. Certain attributes are not computed analytically, and are provided as input to this step in the form of ```.csv``` files. You can ommit this if you do not have the ability to compute them otherwise. These are: object ```material```, object ```texture```, room ```scene_category```, room ```inst_segmentation```, room ```floor_number```, building ```gibson_split```, building ```function```, and building ```num_floors```. Included are examples of the specific file formats for the tiny Gibson split (```model_data.csv```, ```object_data.csv```).
